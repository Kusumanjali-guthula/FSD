    Rajahmundry, officially known as Rajamahendravaram,[8] is a city in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh and District headquarters of East Godavari district. It is the fifth most populated city in the state.[9] During British rule, the District of Rajahmundry was created in the Madras Presidency in 1823.[10] It was reorganised in 1859 and bifurcated into the Godavari and Krishna districts. Rajahmundry was the headquarters of Godavari district, which was further bifurcated into East Godavari and West Godavari districts in 1925. When the Godavari district was bifurcated, Kakinada became the headquarters of East Godavari and Eluru became the headquarters of West Godavari.[11] It is administered under Rajahmundry revenue division of the East Godavari district

    Rajahmundry was under Dutch rule for some time. In 1602, the Dutch constructed a fort here. In 1857, the British conquered the Dutch. They converted it into a jail in 1864 and elevated it into a central jail in 1870. The jail is spread over 196 acres (79 ha) out of which the buildings occupy 37.24 acres (15.07 ha).
