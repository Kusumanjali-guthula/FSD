		<h2>Embedded Logic Dwsign(ELD):</h2>
		<p>
			Embedded systems’ evolution was built from combinational logic families made possible from the discovery of the transistor. The transistor is made from semiconductor material and is compact. It is able to handle large amounts of power quickly. The transistor employs three terminals to activate electron flow for use in downstream devices as electricity.

			<summary>Signals And Systems(S&S):</summary>
			<p>
				In electrical engineering, the fundamental quantity of representing some information is called a signal. It does not matter what the information is i-e: Analog or digital information. In mathematics, a signal is a function that conveys some information. In fact any quantity measurable through time over space or any higher dimension can be taken as a signal. A signal could be of any dimension and could be of any form.

	<h2>Maths III(Multivariable Calculus,Complex Variables,Vector Calculus):</h2>
	<p>
		Calculus III: Multivariable Calculus. The main topic of this course is differentiation of functions of several variables and their applications. Vectors and the equations of lines, planes and quadratics surfaces will be discussed as well as double integrals and their applications.

	<h2>principle of communication system(PCS) circuit theory and devices </h2>
	<p>
		In a broad sense, the term Principles of Communication Systems refers to the sending, receiving and processing of information by electronic means. Communications started with wire telegraphy in the eighteen forties, developing with telephony some decades later and radio at the beginning of this century. Radio communication, made possible by the invention of the triode tube, was greatly improved by the work done during World War II. It subsequently became even more widely used and refined through the invention and use of the transistor, integrated circuits and other semiconductor devices. More recently, the use of satellites and fiber optics has made communications even more widespread, with an increasing emphasis on computer and other data communications.

	<h2>Fields and Waves(F&W) </h2>
	<p>
		Research on electromagnetics covers the entire range of the radio spectrum, from DC all the way to optical frequencies. Our research at high frequencies focuses on the modeling of nano-antennas, microwave circuits, electromagnetic scattering, thermo-acoustic imaging, antennas for underground communications and simulation-driven antenna design. In the lower frequency range we work on novel sensors and simulations of complex magnetic materials, compact low frequency antennas, low frequency propagation in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide and near-field through conductor imaging. Our scope is constantly expanding and specific topics can be viewed in published works.
