<h2>advantage of education</h2>
Education helps a person to get knowledge and improve confidence in life. It can help you improve your career and your personal growth. An educated person can become a great citizen in society. It helps you to take the right decisions in life.
The stakeholders of education, namely, governments, organisations and students themselves agree on its multidimensional essentiality. High-quality education, particularly tertiary education is a major catalyst of development in families across the income spectrum. Further, with the integration of multidimensional goals, the importance of education has been accentuated and individuals have grown more conscious towards the environment and society developing an awareness lacking in previous generations. Published on the World Bank blog, the article “Education is Fundamental to Development and Growth” aptly summarises the fact that education, through various methods, carries the potential to transform people’s lives.
